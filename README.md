# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this project I was tasked with building a simple hour-by-hour scheduler for standard work day hours. I had to present the updated current date, allow users to input events into an hour block, save those events in local storage for page reloads, and to color code hour blocks by status as a past, present, or future entity.

The primary problems I faced involved employing jquery for DOM traversal, event handling, and search/iteration tasks instead of the regular Javascript syntax for those items. I also had to demonstrate a knowledge of how to access third-party APIs (mainly MomentJS for date and time) to bring the scheduler to appropriate functionality.

The following image is a screen shot from the day scheduler:
